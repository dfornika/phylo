# Clojure Parenthesis Repair

The command `clj-paren-repair` is installed on your path.

Examples:
`clj-paren-repair <files>`
`clj-paren-repair path/to/file1.clj path/to/file2.clj path/to/file3.clj`

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT try to manually repair parenthesis errors.
If you encounter unbalanced delimiters, run `clj-paren-repair` on the file
instead of attempting to fix them yourself. If the tool doesn't work,
report to the user that they need to fix the delimiter error manually.

The tool automatically formats files with cljfmt when it processes them.
